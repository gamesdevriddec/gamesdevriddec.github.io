Last updated: 06.06.2024

David Ajanjan ("us", "we", or "our") operates the mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our 
Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect, use, disclose, or retain your personal information or data through the provision of the Service. You

## Gameplay Data
Data resulting from your use of the Service, such as gameplay data, may be sent directly to the respective app stores 
(Apple App Store and Google Play Store) for the purpose of providing in-app purchases and ad serving functionalities.

retained by us. Any data synced with your iCloud account for the purpose of saving your gameplay data is subject to the terms, 
conditions, and policies between you and Apple, while any data synced with your Google account is subject to the terms, 
conditions, and policies between you and Google.

Our Service may display third-party advertisements. These advertisers may use technology to send, directly to your device, 
the advertisements that appear on our Service and they may automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These 
advertisers may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their 
advertisements and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features 
that advertisers may use, and the information practices of these advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please 
contact these advertisers directly for more information about their privacy practices.

## In-App Purchases

Please note that our Service may include in-app purchases. In-app purchases are processed by the respective app stores

policies of those app stores.

## Location Data

The Service does not collect or use any location data from your device.
